# wxHighgui
An OpenCV Graphical User interface using wxWidgets
You can build wxwidgets for windows uing this script (git-bash)

You have to install :

1 zlib and pnglib; on windows system you can use initzlibpng.sh script (git-bash script- cmake must be installed)

2 opencv : on windows system you can use buildocv.sh script

3 wxwidgets : on windows system  you can use buildwxForOpencv.sh





We don't need libtiff and libjeg (inside wxwidgets) and we use pnglib and zlib for wxwidgets and opencv
